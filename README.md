# Ansible Pinephone MMS

This repo has an ansible playbook to setup mms per https://wiki.mobian-project.org/doku.php?id=mms and https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=12491. 

Please make sure the ip address in `hosts` is your mobian pinephone and that the `files/mms` uses your carriers settings. 

Then you can run with `make run`.
